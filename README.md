# Squawker App backend

This is a simple Squawker backend to help understand how to make send downstream messages to squawker clients (Android, iOS, web)

This is just a simple webserver. There is more to learn

We used this backend to test this React native [app](https://github.com/okpalaChidiebere/reactnd-Squawker)

If you want to lean how to use firebase for react web see [Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API), [JS client](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client) and [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/receive?_gl=1*156yvsy*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjkxNjcyNTA4LjE3MTI0Njg0NDE.*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTcxMjQ2ODQ0MS4xLjAuMTcxMjQ2ODQ0MS4wLjAuMA). You MUST have Service workers enabled

# third part libraries

There are third party libraries in go that implemented all these features. These packages might be good to use if you dont want to dive to much and write all code for this. I probably will do if i am in a start up situation. After all, the udacity guys used a third party library for their server :)
